Recommendations:
1. The validation functions take leading and trailing white spaces into consideration.
   Here trim() method could be used to remove these unwanted spaces and there by considering only the required characters in string length count.
   I have Commented out the implementation of trim() method in maxLength.js and minLength.js files
2. I would like to suggest the implementation of APIs for Add and Remove functions. From an automation perspective, the API integration can then be validated using tools like SoapUI/ReadyAPI/Postman
